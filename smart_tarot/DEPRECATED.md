# Legacy Folder Notice

This `smart_tarot/` directory contains legacy implementations and documentation.

- Canonical backend now lives under `smart-divination/backend/`.
- Flutter apps and shared packages are managed under `smart-divination/` (Melos workspace).
- Use `smart-divination/README.md` for up-to-date instructions.

These files remain for historical reference during the migration. New development should target the canonical workspace.
