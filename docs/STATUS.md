# Project Status (October 2025)

Last Updated: 2025-10-22

## Current Status: Android Release Ready
**Focus:** Android signing complete. App successfully tested on physical device. Ready for Play Store assets creation and submission.

## Release Focus
- Android internal testing is the immediate launch path; iOS is deferred until Mac signing hardware is available.
- Tarot backend and Flutter app stay as the launch vehicle (private beta).
- I Ching and runes pipelines exist but remain behind ENABLE_ICHING / ENABLE_RUNES until UX, entitlements, and localisation are ready.
- Content packs live in backend/data/packs/manifests.json; the client entitlement surface is still pending.

## Current Sprint: Pre-Launch Checklist
Target: Android internal testing track (1-2 weeks)
Status: critical blockers cleared on 2025-10-05

Completed work (total ~45 minutes once secrets were available):
1. Deploy backend to Vercel production (15 min)
2. Apply Supabase migrations to production (10 min)
3. Configure Android signing for CI/CD (20 min)
4. Fix Android build failure (app_links compileSdk)
5. Finish localisation migration to CommonStrings

## Recent Progress (2025-10-22)

### UX & Visual Improvements
- **Spread Gallery Layout**: Increased diagram size from 38% to 50% of screen height, making Celtic Cross cards significantly larger and more readable. Fixed text section to 25% max height with scrolling.
- **AI Content Quality**: Completely rewritten "Why this spread?" content with rich 30-50 word bullets (previously 10-15 words). Removed generic intro sentences. First bullet explains WHY the spread is perfect, second provides concrete reading guidance. Increased Gemini temperature to 0.9 and maxTokens to 700 for deeper insights.
- **App Icon**: Updated launcher icon with latest design iteration across all mipmaps (Android & iOS).
- **Quick Actions**: Redesigned home screen quick action tiles with responsive two-column layout (collapses to single column on narrow screens). Now positioned inside the form card directly below the text field. Uses LayoutBuilder for optimal width calculation and maintains compact, visually coherent design with circular highlighted icons.
- **Daily Quotes**: Removed author attribution, showing only quote text for cleaner presentation.

## Recent Progress (2025-10-18)

### UX & AI polish
- Added the AI question formatter endpoint (`POST /api/questions/format`) and updated the Flutter client so even “Consulta General” passes through DeepSeek before hitting the backend.
- When the user leaves the prompt empty, the app now nudges them with a localized tip and still performs the draw using a contextual general question.
- Backend draw endpoint now reuses the canonical spread catalog, preventing `INVALID_SPREAD` errors when the recommender picks spreads like `two_card` or `five_card_cross`.
- Spread reasoning text was rewritten to be more empathetic and didactic in CA/ES/EN without the old “Key factors detected…” boilerplate.

### Infrastructure & Deployment
- Backend production URL: https://backend-jnmkq4odo-dnitzs-projects.vercel.app (health check OK)
- Supabase project vanrixxzaawybszeuivb.supabase.co linked and migrated
- Tables: users, sessions, session_artifacts, session_messages (created via migrations)
- GitHub secrets: 13/13 configured (Android signing, Vercel IDs, Supabase, DeepSeek, Random.org)
- Vercel environment variables: production set in dashboard/CLI
- DeepSeek and Random.org integrations tested (Random.org marked degraded but fallback available)

### Flutter Workspace
- Localisation migration complete; all apps use `CommonStrings`
- Widget tests: 5/5 passing
- `flutter analyze`: clean run (39 s)
- Android build: succeeds with compileSdk 34 and `intl` 0.20.0
- Launcher icon refreshed via `flutter_launcher_icons` (asset at `apps/tarot/assets/app_icon/icon.png`, adaptive background `#8C52FF`)
- Splash artwork and theming polish still pending

### Backend
- Production deployment verified via `scripts/verify-deployment.ps1`
- Lint, build, and type-check pass (`npm run lint`, `npm run build`, `npm run type-check`)
- Centralised error handling in `lib/utils/errors.ts`
- Metrics module ready for Datadog but currently running in console mode
- Supabase session utilities covered by integration tests

### Android Signing
- ✅ CI/CD secrets cover keystore, passwords, and alias
- ✅ `build.gradle.kts` configured with signing (fails fast if config missing)
- ✅ Keystore generated: `upload-keystore.jks` (password: SmartTarot2025!, alias: upload)
- ✅ `android/key.properties` configured with signing credentials
- ✅ Release APK generated and tested: 55MB (`app-release.apk`)
- ✅ Release AAB generated: 45.7MB (`app-release.aab`)
- ✅ App successfully installed and runs on physical Android device
- Helper scripts available: `scripts/android/setup_local_signing.ps1` and `scripts/android/decode_keystore.ps1`

## Next Actions

Short term (immediate - post-signing phase):
- [x] Custom launcher icon integrated (adaptive icons regenerated across mipmaps)
- [x] Update `AndroidManifest.xml` label to "Smart Tarot"
- [x] Document physical-device testing workflow (`docs/RUN_ON_PHONE.md`)
- [x] Run the app on a physical phone and capture the real UI/UX state
- [x] Android signing complete (keystore, key.properties, signed APK/AAB)
- [x] App successfully tested on physical device
- [ ] Identify and prioritise design/UX improvements needed before Play Store screenshots
- [ ] Implement design iterations with hot reload testing
- [ ] Capture screenshots once design is ready (minimum 2 at 1080x1920; aim for 4-8)
- [ ] Create a 1024x500 feature graphic with final branding
- [ ] Produce a 1920x1080 splash artwork and wire up `flutter_native_splash`
- [ ] Host privacy policy and terms of service (EN/ES/CA) and link in Play Console
- [ ] Finalise and localise Play Store listing copy (see `docs/store-metadata/play_store_copy.md`)
- [ ] Configure Google Play Console developer account and Internal Testing track
- [ ] Run full manual QA against production backend (signup, draws, interpretations, history, limits)

Medium term:
- Implement premium entitlement flows and storefront surfaces
- Connect metrics to Datadog/Grafana and establish alert thresholds
- Expand Flutter test coverage with HTTP mocks and offline scenarios
- Resume iOS signing once Mac hardware is available

## Known Gaps
- `VERCEL_TOKEN` still missing (manual CLI deploys work; token needed to automate deploy-on-push)
- Play Store assets and metadata outstanding (screenshots, feature graphic, splash art)
- Privacy policy and terms not yet written or hosted
- I Ching and runes remain feature-flagged until UX and entitlements are finished
- Observability limited to console metrics; Datadog not yet configured
- Row level security policy review pending once entitlement flows land

## Recent Security Actions
- 2025-10-06: Rotated all secrets exposed during deployment automation (Supabase, DeepSeek, Random.org)
- Updated GitHub Secrets and Vercel environment variables with new credentials
- Redeployed backend and re-ran `scripts/verify-deployment.ps1`

## Manual QA Checklist (Tarot) - to schedule after assets/metadata
- Create production test accounts in Supabase
- Exercise signup, login, logout
- Run tarot draw and verify AI interpretation persists
- Check session history and limits (with and without credentials)
- Build release APK/AAB with production defines and corrected `JAVA_HOME`
- Smoke test on physical Android hardware
- Validate backend endpoints with `scripts/verify-deployment.ps1`

## Security Note
Secrets were briefly committed during automation on 2025-10-05. All exposed credentials (Supabase, DeepSeek, Random.org) were rotated on 2025-10-06. See `SECURITY_INCIDENT_RESPONSE.md` for full details.
